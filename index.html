  <h1>🌿 New to Gardening? Here’s Why Your Plants Are Dying (And How to Fix It Today)</h1>

  <p>You bought a few plants, watered them every day… and still, they didn’t make it.<br />
  Don’t worry — you’re not the only one.</p>

  <h2>💡 You’re Not Alone</h2>
  <p>Many beginners face the same issues. They ask:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Why is my soil so dry or muddy?</li>
    <li>Am I watering too much? Or too little?</li>
    <li>Why are bugs eating everything I plant?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The truth is — most people don’t start with the right info. They rush into gardening without knowing the basics. And that’s okay. Everyone starts somewhere.</p>

  <h2>🌻 Imagine This</h2>
  <p>Imagine stepping outside to a fresh, green space.<br />
  Your plants look healthy. The soil feels just right.<br />
  You finally understand how much to water — and when.<br />
  And you’re no longer wasting money on plants that die in days.</p>

  <p>You feel proud. And gardening becomes fun.</p>
